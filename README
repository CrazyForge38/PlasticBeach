I am going to make a script that changes the background of the desktop depending on the time of day

1. The first level concept is that the background will change to the day version of plastic beach during day light and change to the night version at night.

2. I will create a device that will measure the light levels out side and change to day/night depeding the stenght of the light

3. edit a few more bacjgrounds to raining, thunderstorm , ect... 

4. using the day light website, that tells when day light should start depending on the time of year, it will grab that info and change the photos 

Questions: How do i keep the script running whith out as soon as the os turns on or is in rest mode. How often does it check?? i think this is a good enough info to start

how to change the background through the terminal
how to check the date

Change wall paper command: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri "file:///home/david/Pictures/beach_evening.png"
	I recommend that you change the transparentcy of your shell while trying to make sure this works for you.

event at x time:
	There are two ways of doing this. Making it occur every 12 hours or at t = x change
